# Easy Spring Batch Remote Chunking 

This Spring Boot starter provides some default configuration of the capavbilities in the the Spring Batch Integration library which is, annoyingly and confusingly, 
an integration of two separate Spring projects: Spring Batch (duh) _and_ Spring Integration. This library lets you use Spring Integration's innate capabilities 
for system to system communication as a way to connect and orchestrate Spring Batch worker nodes in a larger distributed taxonomy.
